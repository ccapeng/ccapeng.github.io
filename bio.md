I was a teacher and “developer”.

I dreamed of splitting my legs in yoga class, 
riding my Megavalanche mountain bike, 
and teaching React class in Columbia University.

Since the internet was booming, pretty much came out the solution from ground up. 
Understanding all the know how, solving the complications. 
Also I came out some pioneer solutions to save the network bandwidth.

Learning is just part of my life. In the schools, I read books and received knowledge from teacher. Now, I am learning from my life and receiving knowledge from my senses. My routine is pretty much like this  

`Learn > Develop > Work > Focus > Life > Learn ...  `

In this routine, I would address "Focus" particularly.
How many times I wanted to listen music when working, but felt that was too loud to focus. 
The procrastination went on and on. 
I have been told listening the India Flute to gain double efficient, but not convinced. 
Eventually, youtube just became more distracting. 
However, youtube just read my mind and brought me [Jim kwik](https://www.youtube.com/user/kwiklearning).
Bingo, his theory just reflect my mediation practice.


With many years of programming experiences, I have so many to share. 
I have put all my best practices in [https://ccapeng.gitbook.io/programming/](https://ccapeng.gitbook.io/programming/). Welcome to any comments and share it.
Another designing philosophy to share, it's in my bookstore project [https://ccapeng.gitbook.io/bookstores/](https://ccapeng.gitbook.io/bookstores/). 
Furthermore, the team collaboration is essential, the fundamental of software engineering is going to drive to the goal.



Have you taught yourself or have you developed yourself?
