<p>I was a teacher and “developer”.</p>

<p>I dreamed of splitting my legs in yoga class, 
riding my Megavalanche mountain bike, 
and teaching React class in Columbia University.</p>

<p>Since the internet was booming, pretty much came out the solution from ground up. 
Understanding all the know how, solving the complications. 
Also I came out some pioneer solutions to save the network bandwidth.</p>

<p>Learning is just part of my life. In the schools, I read books and received knowledge from teacher. Now, I am learning from my life and receiving knowledge from my senses. My routine is pretty much like this</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Learn &gt; Develop &gt; Work &gt; Focus &gt; Life &gt; Learn ...  </code></p>

<p>In this routine, I would address “Focus” particularly.
How many times I wanted to listen music when working, but felt that was too loud to focus. 
The procrastination went on and on. 
I have been told listening the India Flute to gain double efficient, but not convinced. 
Eventually, youtube just became more distracting. 
However, youtube just read my mind and brought me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/kwiklearning">Jim kwik</a>.
Bingo, his theory just reflect my mediation practice.</p>

<p>With many years of programming experiences, I have so many to share. 
I have put all my best practices in <a href="https://ccapeng.gitbook.io/programming/">https://ccapeng.gitbook.io/programming/</a>. Welcome to any comments and share it.
Another designing philosophy to share, it’s in my bookstore project <a href="https://ccapeng.gitbook.io/bookstores/">https://ccapeng.gitbook.io/bookstores/</a>. 
Furthermore, the team collaboration is essential, the fundamental of software engineering is going to drive to the goal.</p>

<p>Have you taught yourself or have you developed yourself?</p>
